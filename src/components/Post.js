          Hacked verified Facebook pages impersonating Meta are buying ads from Meta
        </h2>

        <p className="post1Content">
          Sketchy Facebook pages impersonating businesses are nothing new, but a flurry of recent scams is particularly brazen.

          A handful of verified Facebook pages were hacked recently and spotted slinging likely malware through ads approved by and purchased through the platform. But the accounts should be easy to catch — in some cases, they were impersonating Facebook itself.

          Social consultant Matt Navarra first spotted some of the ads, sharing them on Twitter. The compromised accounts include official-sounding pages like “Meta Ads” and “Meta Ads Manager.” Those accounts shared suspicious links to tens of thousands of followers, though their reach probably extended well beyond that through paid posts.
